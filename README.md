## Description

This is my final project for Noroff, developed using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It is a holiday booking platform called Holidaze, where users can browse, book, and manage vacation rentals effortlessly.

## Features

- **Dynamic Venue Listings**: Fetches venue data from an API and displays it dynamically on the homepage, with clickable venue cards leading to detailed pages.
- **Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific venues using a responsive search bar, filtering results dynamically as they type.
- **Venue Details Pages**: Each venue has a dedicated page displaying images, descriptions, prices, reviews, and available dates.
- **Booking System**: Registered users can book venues by selecting available dates from an interactive calendar, with real-time price calculation.
- **User Account Management**: Registered users can update their profile, including avatar and bio, and manage their upcoming bookings.
- **Venue Management for Managers**: Venue managers can create, update, or delete their venues, and view all bookings made for their managed venues.
- **Responsive Design**: Ensures the website works seamlessly on different devices, providing a smooth user experience across all screen sizes.
- **Authentication**: Users can register, log in, and log out using secure authentication, with role-based access for customers and venue managers.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: React-based framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation, providing improved performance, SEO, and flexibility for building modern web applications.
- **TypeScript**: Adds static type checking to JavaScript, enhancing code quality and understandability.
- **Tailwind**: Utility-first CSS framework that allows developers to quickly design responsive and custom user interfaces using predefined classes, enhancing both speed and design consistency.
- **Netlify**: The project is deployed and hosted on Netlify, providing global distribution and high availability.
